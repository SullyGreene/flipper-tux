# --- Example for the future ---
#
# Let's assume user data will be stored in a 'data/' directory.
# The following lines show how a backup would be created.

# if [ -d "data" ]; then

#     tar -czvf "$BACKUP_DIR/$FILENAME" data
#     echo "‚úÖ Backup created at: $BACKUP_DIR/$FILENAME"

#     echo "No 'data' directory to back up yet."
# fi
# --- End of Example ---
